My solutions in Python to [Advent of Code 2019](https://adventofcode.com/2019) problems.
[MyPy](https://mypy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) is used for static typechecking and [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/) is used for unit testing.
This project also uses VS Code's [Remote Container Development extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers) so you can have the exact same setup as I do by
- Install the extension,
- Hit F1, choose "Open Folder in Container..." and open the project root directory.
